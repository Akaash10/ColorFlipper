# ColorFlipper
A simple colorflipper webpage by using the frontend-tools ( HTML,CSS &amp; JS )

A webpage designed for the User Interface. 
Whenever the button is clicked, onClick() will call the colorChange function.

Under the functionality, we have a certain number of color names constructed under an array.
By using the Math.random(), it will select a random array value.
By using the random value, the color will be chosen and stored in a variable.
By using the id, the color will be applied across the selected div element.
